I am a Lecturer in Criminology at the University of Surrey. I have conducted research on the issues covered by the current enquiry, particularly on drug law enforcement and its impact on drug markets. In this response to the request of the Home Affairs Select Committee for evidence on drugs, I draw from both my own and other research to address the last question posed by the committee about international comparisons.

## International comparisons

In 2010, 65% of the UK drug-related public expenditure focused on supply reduction efforts,[^fn1] and the UK Government’s new drugs strategy promised another £300 million.[^fn2] This is not surprising given that even countries with a notably lenient approach towards illicit drugs tend to spend more on enforcement than they do on prevention, treatment, and harm reduction combined.[^fn3] The question is, therefore, to what extent these efforts are effective in dismantling the criminal networks involved in the supply, trafficking, and dealing of drugs and, ultimately, reducing drug use, drug related deaths, and drug related offending.

*Are there laws, policies or approaches adopted in other countries that have been effective in reducing: drug use, drug related deaths, and/or drug related offending?*

Despite the popularity and significant investment in drug law enforcement, scholars have questioned its outcomes,[^fn4] highlighting how the resilience and flexibility of drug markets prevents any successes to be long-term. This point was also recently made by Professor Dame Carol Black in her phase one report to the Home Office, where she noted that *‘even if these [police, border forces, etc.] organisations were sufficiently resourced, it is not clear that they would be able to bring about a sustained reduction in drug supply, given the resilience and flexibility of illicit drug markets’*.[^fn5]

Studies that focused on the impact of drug law enforcement on specific criminal groups involved in the trafficking and dealing of illicit drugs have highlighted the ‘relative ineffectiveness’ of these approaches due to the ability of criminal networks to replace those who are arrested, and to adapt to the new circumstances.[^fn6] Drug trafficking networks have proven to be resilient to targeted interventions by law enforcement agencies (Berlusconi, 2021; Bright and Delaney, 2013).[^fn7][^-][^fn8] Even when entire groups are dismantled by law enforcement following multiple arrests, drug markets have shown to be resilient as new dealers replace those who are sentenced and imprisoned (Bouchard, 2007; Duin et al., 2014).

Cross-border interdictions suffer from similar shortcomings. An analysis of both heroin and cocaine trafficking routes to Europe has shown how law enforcement does not seem to play a role in explaining why traffickers prefer some routes over others (Aziani et al., 2019; Giommoni et al., 2017). Drug trafficking routes are instead influenced by the number of people who use drugs in individual countries whereby the more people who use drugs in a country, the more a country will be involved in cross-border drug trafficking (both as transit and as destination country). These findings suggest that non-coordinated interventions are likely to have little impact on the international supply of illicit drugs (Giommoni et al., 2021), and that demand reduction efforts that focus on people who use drugs might ultimately help limit the supply of drugs, too.

*If so, could they reasonably be expected to work in the UK?*

Given the relative ineffectiveness of supply reduction efforts in other countries (Duijn et al., 2014; Berlusconi, 2021) and at international level (Giommoni et al., 2021), it seems unlikely that similar efforts will produce different outcomes in the UK. While more research on drug law enforcement is needed (Reuter, 2017), available evidence suggests a focus on prevention and treatment might be more effective and, ultimately, contribute to reducing drug supply, too.
