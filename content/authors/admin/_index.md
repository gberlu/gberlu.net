I am a lecturer in criminology in the [Department of Sociology](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-sociology) at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk). My research focuses on illicit and unregulated markets, and primarily on three areas: drug markets; commercial sex markets; organised crime and illicit markets. I am particularly interested in fusing criminology scholarship with quantitative methodologies, and using social network analysis to explore co-offending, deviant behaviour, and victimisation.
